  <p> Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a digital asset that uses cryptography to control its creation and management, rather than relying on central authorities.</p>
  <ul>
    
   <li>Originally designed as a medium of exchange, Bitcoin is now primarily regarded as a store of value.</li>
    <li>The history of bitcoin started with its invention and implementation by Satoshi Nakamoto, who integrated many existing ideas from the cryptography community</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The first retail transaction involving physical goods was paid on May 22, 2010, by exchanging 10,000 mined BTC for two pizzas delivered from a local pizza restaurant in Florida, marking May 22 as the Bitcoin Pizza Day for crypto-fans.At the time, a transaction's value was typically negotiated on the Bitcoin forum.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>On 6 August 2010, a major vulnerability in the bitcoin protocol was spotted. While the protocol did verify that a transaction's outputs never exceeded its inputs, a transaction whose outputs summed to more than {\displaystyle 2^{64}}2^{{64}} would overflow, permitting the transaction author to create arbitrary amounts of bitcoin.</li>
    <li>On 15 August, the vulnerability was exploited; a single transaction spent 0.5 bitcoin to send just over 92 billion bitcoins ({\displaystyle 2^{63}}{\displaystyle 2^{63}} satoshis) to each of two different addresses on the network. Within hours, the transaction was spotted, the bug was fixed, and the blockchain was forked by miners using an updated version of the bitcoin protocol.</li>
    <li>Since the blockchain was forked below the problematic transaction, the transaction no longer appears in the blockchain used by the Bitcoin network today. This was the only major security flaw found and exploited in bitcoin's history.</li>
